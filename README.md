Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

#Project Overview

The Telecom Customer Churn Prediction project aims to identify the key factors contributing to customer churn and develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). By understanding these factors, telecom companies can implement proactive strategies to retain customers and reduce churn rates.

#Project Objectives

1.Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify significant features contributing to customer churn.

2.Develop a classification model using ANN to predict whether a customer will churn.

3.Provide actionable insights based on EDA to help design effective customer retention programs.

4.Enable periodic churn prediction to allow the company to take preemptive measures to retain customers.

#Methodology

A. Data Collection

The data used in this project comes from a telecom company, including customer demographics, account information, and service usage patterns.

B. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is conducted to uncover the underlying patterns in the data and identify key features that contribute to customer churn. This step involves:

1.Descriptive statistics to understand the data distribution.

2.Visualizations to identify trends and correlations.

3.Feature engineering to create new variables that may influence churn.

#Model Building

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is built for the classification task. The steps include:

1.Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.

2.Model Architecture: Designing the ANN structure with input, hidden, and output layers.

3.Training and Validation: Splitting the data into training and validation sets, and training the ANN model.

4.Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

#Results

The ANN model achieved a high level of accuracy in predicting customer churn. The model's performance metrics are as follows:

Accuracy: [Value]%

Precision: [Value]%

Recall: [Value]%

F1 Score: [Value]%
