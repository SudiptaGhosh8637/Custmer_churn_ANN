 In order to develop the customer retention program it's important to understand the biggest contributor to customer churning. We will be able to identify those features using exploratory data analysis. We will also build the model which can predict whether that customer churn or not. So based on our EDA analysis the company can design the proactive program that will avoid all those factors which leads to customer attrition and using our ML model they can periodically check whether the customer can leave or not and accordingly take measures to retain the customer.
